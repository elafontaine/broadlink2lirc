Broadlink2lirc
==============

This is just a small project I had to do to convert codes from broadlink model to lirc model.

The idea was to do a quick and easy script for re-adjusting the lircs file for my raspberry pi.

This could be adjusted to change the name of the generated remote, the source file used (from any remotes) and/or the base frequency/units.
